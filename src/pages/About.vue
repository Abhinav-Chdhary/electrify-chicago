    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <p>
      Electrify Chicago is a project looking to shed light onto one of the biggest source's of
      Chicago's CO<sub>2</sub> emissions - buildings. In showing more details about some of the
      city's most polluting buildings, we hope to encourage these buildings to electrify,
      particularly by mobilizing people related to the building - whether that be students and
      faculty for a college building or employees and patients at a hospital.
